# deaglemafia-internal
 The [deaglemafia] internal project. Based on [danielkrupinski's Osiris](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/osiris). 
 
# NOT MAINTAINED
Definitely needs updating 99% of the cheat to the newest version of Osiris. Considering as this cheat was mostly only a GUI change, it shouldn't really be a problem.

# What's changed compared to 'vanilla' Osiris?
Some features are poorly removed; complete menu rework; new menu theme (VGUI-esque).
